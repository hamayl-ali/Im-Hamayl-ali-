# Im-Hamayl-ali

I am currently pursuing a Bachelor’s in Computer Science at COMSATS Islamabad (since 2024), driven by a deep passion for computer networking and cybersecurity that began long before my university journey. As I delve into increasingly advanced concepts, my enthusiasm for these fields only intensifies. I am eager to harness this passion to make a meaningful impact in the rapidly evolving world of technology.

I thrive on building projects that bridge theory with real-world applications—ranging from firewall simulations to port scanners and packet sniffers. My hands-on approach to understanding networks at a low level not only sharpens my technical skills but also fuels my problem-solving mindset. I am committed to continuous learning and innovation, always seeking new ways to enhance network security and efficiency.

I’m also working towards opportunities for higher studies, to specialize in network security and system design. My goal is to contribute to innovative research and practical solutions that enhance network safety and efficiency.
